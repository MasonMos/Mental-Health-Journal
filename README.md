# Mental Health Journal App

This project is for Headstarter's Week 1 Hackathon 2024. This is a collaborative project with JeremiahD9. The full vision of this app is to create a journaling social media app that helps people journal about their life. This is nowhere near the final product and will be updated further in the future to support mobile and be created as an app.

Here is a demo of the project: [https://youtu.be/GWtnCnGUv40](url)
